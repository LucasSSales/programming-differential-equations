Programming Differential Equations
==================================

A repository that stores the work from Udacity's course: Differential Equations in Action, and examples from A Primer on Scientific Programming using Python.

For the Udacity's part, the repository currently comprises the following problems:


Lesson 1: Houston we have a problem
-----------------------------------


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
For the Primer on Scientific Programming, the repository currently comprises the following problems:

Examples are based on A Primer on Scientific Programming using Python, and currently include:
- simple first order du/dt = u in first_order.py
- spring mass system in springmass.py
- logistic equation for population growth

It shows how to solve ODE with object-oriented feature and class hierarchy.
Solvers used include Forward Euler, 4th order Runge-Kutta and Backward Euler method. All the solvers are located in ODESolver.py
